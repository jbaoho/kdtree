# kdtree

This repository is a project from Princeton's Algorithms class. The assignment aims to represent a space-partitioning scheme for points in a k-dimensional space. The kdtree is represented using a binary tree structure that partitions a space into different sections based on the order and positions of points being inserted into the tree. This allows for the kdtree to be queried to see if it contains a specific point by going either direction from the partition of a point in the tree until the point is reached or the end of the tree. The tree is also able to be queried to see what the nearest point from another point is using the same method, however, checking each time if a closer point could exist based on the partitioning scheme of the kdtree. The repository contains the code to the project within the src folder as well as files to test the code is functioning properly.
